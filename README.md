# Short video gallery  
  This is a project based on [ideia](https://www.br.freelancer.com/projects/website-design/Website-organized-gallery-short-video/details), I believe this project is a portfolio for video editing.
At the moment the website does not have a register of new projects, but it demonstrates the use of videos uploaded on the website and external videos from YouTube.<br>
I will add new features such as importing videos from Instagram, registering new projects and improving the website layout.
